These are editable text files that can change the way the game works. 

init.txt has many game settings that can be changed.

colorscheme.txt has colors that can be changed (when creating menus and etc.
these colors will be used. I wanted it to be this way so that the user could change the colors if they
wanted to)

units.txt has types of units that can be changed or added.
