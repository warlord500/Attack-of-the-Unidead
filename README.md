# Attack of the Unidead

On one particularly ordinary day, something fascinating happened. There was a flash of light, followed by an intense storm.
Upon the storm subsiding, the dead began to rise from their graves. Only the chosen one, the *unicycler*, can save us now.

This is a group project by the students of the Computer Science department at CCC. A roguelike dungeon-crawler with a nonsense
and absurd take on its theme. The project uses Unity.
